# Code Challenge day 2 - 19th September 2023

## Assignment
- Build 4 apis using Golang in 30 mins
    - /user/login -> POST -> No auth
    - /user/signUp -> POST -> No auth
    - /post -> POST -> Authentication, Authorization
    - /posts -> GET -> Authentication, Authorization

## Results
- Created GET requests for each of the above apis
- Stopped worrying about the structure of the code and worried about solving the problem at hand 
- Failed to create authentication and authorization mechanisms due to time constraints
- Failed to connect to a JSON file for sample data 
- Failed to connect to DB
- Failed to connect to Redis
- Failed to consider performance

## Next Steps
- Connect to JSON file
- Connect to DB
- Connect to Redis
- Configure .env in golang
- Setup docker
- Setup performance metrics
    - Optimize query time
